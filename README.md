# XCalc

We all have a pre-installed calculator app on our mobiles and our computers. They provide us the basic and some advanced operations. For most people, that's more than enough. But for me, as a Mathematics student, that's not enough. Hence, I thought of developing a (web) app that provides the stuff that I wanted. That's XCalc.

By the way, XCalc is the first name that came to my mind. So it will be renamed for a better name soon. If you have a better name for this app, and you can share it. There is a high chance that your suggestion replaces the name "XCalc".

## Functionalities

These are the functionalities that I wanted in XCalc. The functionalities listed below, are already built (but not available for public use).

- Checking if a number is a prime number
- Factorization of a number
- Ratio calculation
- Greatest Common Factor
- Least Common Divisor calculation

I am constantly thinking about more functionalities to add. I listed some of the ideas which would be useful (in my opinion).

- Division as improper fraction.

## You got ideas?

In case, you have an idea for a functionality or something else, why don't you share it with others?

Just, open up an issue, [here](https://github.com/sahithyandev/x-calc/issues).
Make sure to explain the what and why in a detailed way. Because nobody wants to waste our time asking "Can you explain about it?".

If I think that functionality is useful and worth implementing, I will add it here. Don't worry, I will be genuine and not rude.

## When will XCalc become usable?

If you have read this much, then I hope you are interested in using XCalc. XCalc is not yet available for public use, I am trying to make it available soon.

I am constantly working on XCalc everyday, to make it available for everyone. It's a little hard for me to find time between my tight school schedule, but I am trying my best.
